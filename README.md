# network-intrusion-lab
The StarLiNG Lab focused on identifying and classifying malicious network activity using machine learning techniques. Interns worked with real-world network traffic datasets to detect patterns indicative of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and other threats. The project involved parsing raw data to extract features such as IP addresses, ports, and protocols, engineering machine learning pipelines, and evaluating multiple classifiers on their ability to accurately detect intrusions. Interns explored both supervised (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost) and unsupervised (e.g., Isolation Forest) learning approaches, optimized model parameters, and visualized results through confusion matrices and evaluation metrics. The lab culminated in a final presentation to faculty and the Director of Machine Learning at UTD.
